# GitHub Repository Demo

This repository is a demonstration of the basic steps involved in creating a GitHub repository, cloning it to my desktop, and performing an initial file upload. The process includes creating a 'helloworld.py' file, writing code within the file, and pushing it to GitHub.

   - Open your GitHub account.
   - Choose 'New repository.'
   - Follow the prompts to create my new repository.

2. **Clone the Repository to Your Desktop:**
   - Open Git Bash.
   - Use the `git clone` command to clone the repository to my local machine.

3. **Create and Edit 'helloworld.py':**
   - Create a new Python file named 'helloworld.py.'
   - Add my Python code to this file.

4. **Upload 'helloworld.py' to GitHub:**
   - Use the `git add .` command to stage my changes.
   - Commit my changes with `git commit -m "Print a string"`.
   - Push the changes to GitHub with `git push origin main`.
